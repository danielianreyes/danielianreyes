### 👋 Hello! My name is **Daniel Ian** and I am currently a recent Computer Science graduate from the *University of California, Irvine*!  

I am from *West Covina, California* but I was born in the city of *Muntinlupa* in the *Philippines*. I'm particularly interested in web development and software engineering with a strong focus on building clean, user-friendly applications. Through personal and collaborative projects, I’ve worked with a variety of modern tools while continuing to explore different areas of computer science.

I enjoy learning new technologies, tackling challenging problems, and collaborating with people from diverse backgrounds to build meaningful solutions.
