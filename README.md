### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is **Daniel Ian** and I am currently a first year computer science major studying at the *University of California, Irvine*!  

I am from *West Covina, California* but I was born in the city of *Muntinlupa* in the *Philippines*. I am interested in front-end development and have been working on getting familiar with various front-end tools. I have also developed an interest in competitive programming which is something that I have been wanting to delve into further!
